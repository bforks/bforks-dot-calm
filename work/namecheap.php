			<h1>Kilobyte Couture</h1>
			<p>From 2006-2010 I ran a small jewelry business called Kilobyte Couture. I made pieces out of vintage, unused computer components. In 2007 I was asked by Watson-Guptill, a subsidiary of Random House to create a how-to book based on my jewelry line. Here is some work from Kilobyte Couture as well as the cover and sample spreads from the book. Over the four year lifespan I went through four website revisions, two shopping carts, as well as two branding campaigns.

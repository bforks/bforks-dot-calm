		<h1>Kiip Kudos</h1>
		<p>Kudos is a iOS/Android app that rewards you for your social media activity on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin. I inherited this app from Kiip's former designer, <a href="http://www.heyadam.com/" target="_blank">Adam Debreczeni</a>. Adam did an excellent job setting up the foundation for Kudos. My main focus was transitioning Kudos from iOS 6 to an iOS 7 based design. I also created the onboarding flow and overall branding for the app. </p>

	<div class="description-text" style="clear: both;">
		<p>Since Kudos is a new product, one of the main objectives of the onboarding is to educate users on the purpose of the app. I designed the onboarding to be as lightweight and concise as possible.</p>

		<p>The interior pages of kudos were designed to take design cues from the iOS 7 to create a familiar environment.</p>
		<p>The welcome screen (far left) is to give users some clues about actions they can take to recieve rewards.</p>
		<p>When you achieve an reward you'll be shown the reward screen (second from left). I wanted to promently display the reward along with detailed steps on how you can redeem your reward. My main goal was to make redeeming rewards as easy as possible.</p>
		<p>The reward detail screen (second from right) gives you details about what you did to achieve your reward. Your avatar along with the action you preformed is placed promenently</p>
		<p>The last screen shows the Kudos reward feed. This is the central view in the app. This shows gives you a quick view of the rewards you've earned in the past and how you earned them.</p>

		<p>For the branding, I wanted to create a mark that represents achivement. At first I began with the concept of a present mixed with a heart. But eventually I found the concept to be difficult to understand at first glance, so I moved to the first place ribbon design and refined from there. </p>
